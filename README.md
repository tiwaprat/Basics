**Overview**
This repository contains a collection of various projects created as experiments in building and configuring infrastructure. The objective of these simple projects is to deepen the understanding of fundamental concepts and how they apply to real-world use cases.

**Project 1:** This project focuses on firewall settings and iptables configuration, exploring how these configurations can impact access to resources or applications running on an EC2 instance. It highlights key aspects of network security and access control.

**Project 1:**This project involves a simple Python-based application running on an EC2 instance, featuring a Flask-based user interface. The application allows users to input data, which is then stored in a MySQL database. This application is designed to integrate with other infrastructure configurations and demonstrate the interaction between different components.
